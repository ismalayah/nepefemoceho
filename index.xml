"Coffy" starred Pam Grier as a nurse who goes on the warpath against drug dealers, and was one of the year's top money-makers. And then came "Cleopatra Jones," which is about a federal agent who wages war with the pushers. If the two plots sound similar, there may be a couple of reasons: (a) most black movies objectify the enemy as white gangsters ripping off the ghetto; (b) both movies were written by Max Julien.</description></item><item><title>How Tall is Chris Evans?</title><link>/how-tall-is-chris-evans.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/how-tall-is-chris-evans.html</guid><description>When it comes to superheroes on the big screen few can compete with Captain America himself portrayed by the ever-talented Chris Evans.

In fact, if directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck had followed through on one of their early ideas, then the movie may have ended on the same planet that a certain God of Thunder would unintentionally visit a couple of decades later. And since this unrealized idea ties in heavily with the conclusion of Captain Marvel, be warned that some pretty big spoilers lie ahead.</description></item><item><title>5-letter words starting with CR Wordle Game Help</title><link>/5-letter-words-starting-with-cr-wordle-game-help.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/5-letter-words-starting-with-cr-wordle-game-help.html</guid><description>Wordle is a great way to test your mind each day but sometimes we require a little extra help to get things done.
